üß† K3s High-Availability Cluster

A lightweight yet highly available K3s Kubernetes cluster designed for homelab and edge deployments.
This setup combines PostgreSQL, HAProxy, and Keepalived to provide a fully redundant control-plane endpoint with Cilium as the CNI.

üöÄ Overview

This cluster runs a high-availability (HA) K3s control plane with:

2 PostgreSQL nodes providing a redundant backend database

HAProxy + Keepalived on the same nodes for API server load balancing and failover

3 K3s control-plane nodes connected to the shared PostgreSQL backend

Cilium as the CNI (Container Network Interface)

The architecture ensures fault tolerance, automatic failover, and stable networking for all workloads.

üß© Components
üêò PostgreSQL (K3s Backend)

Provides a shared datastore for the K3s control planes.

Both nodes replicate the K3s data, ensuring no single point of failure.

PostgreSQL runs in a primary/replica setup.

‚öôÔ∏è HAProxy + Keepalived

HAProxy load-balances incoming K3s API requests (:6443) across all control-plane nodes.

Keepalived provides a Virtual IP (VIP) ‚Äî 10.10.10.150 ‚Äî which floats between both HAProxy nodes.

Ensures continuous API availability even if one node fails.

‚ò∏Ô∏è K3s Control Plane

3 nodes: cp1, cp2, and cp3

All control-plane nodes connect to PostgreSQL for state synchronization.

Each runs the K3s API server and scheduler.

üß¨ Cilium (CNI)

Provides eBPF-powered networking and security.

Replaces Flannel for high-performance network policies and observability.

Enables direct routing and Hubble for network visibility.
